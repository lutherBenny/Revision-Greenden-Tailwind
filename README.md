# 🌿 Greenden - Tailwind CSS Project

This project is part of my **MERN Stack Revision Journey (Day 11–13)**, where I focused on revising **Tailwind CSS**. To practice and reinforce my learning, I built a simple, modern, and fully responsive landing page for a fictional plant shop called **Greenden** using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📌 Project Description

**Greenden** is a clean and responsive website designed to mimic a modern e-commerce landing page. It features a hero section, product listings, testimonials, and a footer—all styled entirely with **Tailwind CSS utility classes**, without writing custom CSS.

This project helped me understand how Tailwind CSS simplifies styling with its utility-first approach and allows faster and more organized development.
